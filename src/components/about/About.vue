          Hello! I'm Karol Wi≈õniewski from Toru≈Ñ, Poland. My passion for computers began in
          childhood, where I first explored simple graphic modifications using Gimp. This interest
          in computer graphics grew throughout high school and led me to discover a love for
          programming during my university years‚Äîa passion that has stayed with me ever since.
